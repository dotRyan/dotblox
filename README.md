This is a collection of tools I will slowly be moving from my private repository 
into here. These are tools that I made for my own workflows or ones that I have
created for colleagues. Some of them are based on scripts that I have found 
around the internet and recreated because A. It needed to be paid for or, B. It
did not do what I wanted. 

Feel free to give suggestions/feedback. PRs are also welcome.

This repositories structure is setup to handle multiple dcc apps. That being 
said each dcc will have separate install instructions

I also curate a personal wiki that I use to store random snippets that I do 
over and over again or have had to send to various people.
